Another thing to improve that I didn't include in my other webpage notes: maybe add HTML tool-tips
(see how-to page on W3Schools) so focused (active) elements show the contents of their title attribute
when this wouldn't normally appear (keyboard navigation/mobile browser - no mouse over). Include an
explanation like this as a comment in the HTML code. Also, make sure that keyboard navigation on the
website works well (it should do anyway) and includes some keyboard shortcuts e.g. Esc to close.

When I have some more money from getting paid as an adult, after adding the webpage files
to Github and other to-do list improvements done, I would like to buy website hosting with
an internet domain name like the one in my other idea notes.
With other webpage idea notes about adding a bit more spacing, something that I think should work for
the problem is: • most outer spacing between things should be 0.4em-1em • also testing the spacing on
tablet, smartphone devices with "Desktop site" option • on smartphone devices (small width media query),
add style for body font size to be 14px and its option for that in the footer (other idea note) to be 0.875em.

In my room escape game, I should make a "Game editor", opened from the main menu and using
functions in another JS file, ending in "_editor.js". On the right side of the game area,
it should have a "Item properties" area with form inputs for editing items, with "New item",
"Make copy" and "Delete" buttons above the heading (and scrolling area).
