## Steps to show these webpages locally

The following instructions/steps are about how to show a local copy of these webpages  
on a Raspberry Pi or other computer that has a (GNU/)Linux based OS (operating system)  
installed on it - for example, Raspbian or Debian.

It installs and uses CheckInstall (info at <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall>)  
to "keep track of all the files created or modified by the installation script, build  
a binary package and install it, giving you the ability to uninstall it"  
(quote from <https://wiki.debian.org/CheckInstall>).

\[...delete when done: add more to sub-headings in this section, when installing the software on my next RPi  
 \- use the same config and file paths as the current one (download repo. folder) and use CheckInstall]

### Install the software.

Download [this]\(+ link) bash (shell) script.

Then, in the folder that has the file, open it and  
choose to execute in a terminal (command line app).

### Add config, files and run commands.
