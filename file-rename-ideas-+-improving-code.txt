form_auth_keys.php
 -> rename to something like: page_auth_keys.php
user_accounts/sign_up_and_login_session.php

user_accounts/too_many_password_attempts_blocks.php

Use <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12240922/what-is-the-length-of-a-php-session-id-string>
for one of my notes about editing those files - and in the
database managing one, change these user columns:
 - password one so it "Fits the length/size of cryptographic function used by the password hash code"
 (add that in a comment), edit code so it "Saves to database and compares (to verify) user passwords,
 after [\n] converting them to a hash using the extension at <http://php.net/manual/en/book.password.php>."
 (add that in a comment, at start of file).
 - user options one so "Options / metadata are saved to and loaded from text in
 [\n] the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) syntax using a built-in extension."
 (add that in a comment), make the column size fit that (a medium text length).

In those files of my user account system (more about that in my 2018
paper notes), I should add at end of the first paragraph in its README
"I am adding features to this that other user account (PHP) libraries have,  
sometimes using a process in my code that's similar to how some code in  
another library works (to help me write my code)." and try to do that.


Another thing to improve that I didn't include in my other webpage notes: add (HTML) tool-tips,
see how-to page on W3Schools, so focused (active) elements show the contents of their title attribute
when this wouldn't normally appear (keyboard navigation/mobile browser - no mouse over). Include an
explanation like this as a comment in the HTML code. Also, make sure that keyboard navigation on the
website works well (it should do anyway) and includes some keyboard shortcuts e.g. Esc to close.


When I have some more money from getting paid as an adult, after adding the webpage files
to Github and other to-do list improvements done, I would like to buy website hosting with
an internet domain name like the one in my other idea notes.

With other webpage idea notes about adding a bit more spacing, something that I think should work for
the problem is: • most outer spacing between things should be 0.4em-1em • also testing the spacing on
tablet, smartphone devices with "Desktop site" option • on smartphone devices (small width media query),
add style for body font size to be 14px and its option for that in the footer (other idea note) to be 0.875em.


In my room escape game, I should make a "Game editor", opened from the main menu and using
functions in another JS file, ending in "_editor.js". On the right side of the game area,
it should have a "Item properties" area with form inputs for editing items, with "New item",
"Make copy" and "Delete" buttons above the heading (and scrolling area).

In my platform game, I should do the following sentence, to add in "About & licenses" area
(from the main menu, add that area to my room escape game): "This platform game uses a 2d
physics engine for JavaScript, found at the page [URL hyperlink] and licensed under the
[...add description...]" - choose one from my Google search "2d physics engine javascript".

In addition to these games, I can make 3 files named "HTML5 games app", "HTML5_games" and
"HTML5_games (app embed version)". The second one is a PHP webpage like the homepage, move the games to it.
The third is the second but a HTML file, only main area in body, "head data copied from file and removed
items that aren't needed - but added some styles from linked file that are needed to an in-line element"
(add that in a comment there) and file paths in body made relative (no "/" at start).

The first is a Python file that uses a Qt lib (from tutorial programs) to run an app window that includes
a text line "A (desktop) app that plays HTML5 games from [webpages name]." and embeds the third webpage
after the text. In its code, it gets user home folder (built-in lib), checks if this has the app folder,
if not creates it and downloads latest game files to there from Github repo raw URLs.
